The game's main protagonist is Prophet, a nanosuit holder who had previously appeared in Crysis and Crysis 2. He returns in Crysis 3 as Crytek considered him as the most complex character who has the longest heritage in the series. When designing him, the team took inspiration from the protagonist of District 9.[27] Psycho from the original Crysis and Crysis Warhead returns as Prophet's companion.[28] The game revolves around Prophet attempting to redeem himself by taking revenge after finding his former squad members are dead.[7][29] The story explores the themes of redemption and revenge as well as the relationship between humans and technology.[30] Mike Read, the game's producer, summed up the game calling it "human".[31] Unlike Crysis 2's protagonist Alcatraz who does not speak throughout the game, Prophet is voiced in Crysis 3 in an effort to deliver more emotional connection.[31] The company made use of performance capture to record actor's performance, body movements and facial expressions. According to Read, this helps the company to create a more affecting and emotional story. This was not done in the previous games due to technological limitations.[32]

So if we want to make sure you experience a massive Michael Bay moment, then it's no good to place you in the middle of a big grass field then crossing your fingers and hoping that you will see it. On the other hand, if we want to empower you in the sense of control in that you can plan things out and execute them and get a great feeling of success afterwards, then it's not cool to put you in a sewage pipe, because there's not a lot of variety there.
— Rasmus Højengaard, director of Crysis 3 regarding the game's structure.
Unlike the original Crysis, which gives players more freedom to explore, Crysis 2 was criticized for being too linear.[24] As a result, in developing the game's campaign, Crytek attempted to integrate the two major aspects of the previous installments, the freedom given in the original Crysis and the linearity of Crysis 2. Despite not being as open as the first half of Crysis, maps are significantly larger in this game than in previous installments. Several linear segments were preserved.[33] Crytek referred to the game's map as "action bubbles", which do not necessarily fix players in a small place but allows them to move around freely.[34] Linearity was preserved as developers considered having such segments present could help players to experience "epic" moments and "massive Michael Bay" moments.[23][33] Crytek hoped that by opening up levels they could give players a sense of control, allowing them to plan and execute strategy.[33] The game's seven levels were developed simultaneously, and the focus phrases of gameplay, art and optimization of a level was about one to two weeks.[21]

Another theme featured in the game is "hunt" and, as a result, many weapons were built around the concept. The studio wanted to stay away from typical weapon design and did not want a weapon to simply differentiate between Crysis 3 and Crysis 2. The team aimed to use weapons to create narrative. The game features a compound bow which is reminiscent of a weapon that a hunter often uses. The game's gameplay is built based on three pillars, access, adapt, and attack.[7] Players are often tasked to do detect, spot, and to learn their enemies' behaviors and patterns before attacking. With the bow, players are encouraged to play the game stealthily, extending the game's combat. A new feature called "hacking" was developed. According to Crytek, hacking plays a huge role throughout the game.[35] The game's combat was also made more fast-paced than that of its predecessors.[23]

One of the major goals in developing Crysis 3 was to "push graphics",[36] as the company considered that they can effectively assist and drive gameplay and create immersion for the player.[37] The game is powered by CryEngine 3, Crytek's proprietary engine. It utilizes some of the newest features of CryEngine 3, such as volumetric fog shadows, improved dynamic vegetation, dynamic caustics, improved area lighting and diffuse shadows.[38] After Crysis 2 received some criticism from PC gamers because of the design sacrifices made due to the limitations of the older console hardware, Crytek responded that the PC version of Crysis 3 will figuratively "melt down PCs" due to its high system requirements.[39] The PC version of the game required a DirectX 11 compatible video card and operating system.[40] Similar to Crysis 2, the game is a multi-platform title, and Crytek considered the development of the game's console version a huge obstacle they had to "rip the engine to pieces" so as to get the game running on console.[41]
