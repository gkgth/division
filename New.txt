The player can use various gadgets and gear. One such gadget is the hook mine. The hook mine can be placed on any surface, including walls and ceilings, and will grab any enemies and pull them towards it. This can be used to non-lethally neutralise a target or hide a body, though two hook mines placed nearby to each other can rip NPCs in half (killing them).[1]

After the first mission, the player gains access to three supernatural abilities, which cost energy to use; this energy regenerates to full over a short amount of time. Unlike previous games in the series, these abilities are all unlocked at the same time.[2] Lurk's main mobility power is "Displace", which allows her to set a marker in the world. The player can then teleport to it at-will at any time.[3] "Semblance" allows the player to take the faces of living NPCs and use them as a temporary disguise, though they can only take a character's face once. The disguise drains power as the player moves, but not when they are standing still.[4] Using Semblance on specific named NPCs may produce unique interactions. Completing the game unlocks an "original game plus" mode, where the player has access to some powers featured in Dishonored 2.[3]

During missions, the player may pick up optional "Contracts" at black markets, which are side missions that involve doing tasks such as assassinating another character.[5] In one example, the character is tasked with killing a mime and making it look like a suicide.[
