iIntrigued by the player's supernatural talent of clairvoyance, a struggling university department asks them to join their secret research team, making them a front-field operative in paranormal investigations. Using a wide range of ghost-hunting gadgets and abilities they will conduct missions to investigate real haunted sites, collect samples and gather evidence.

Each mission is an open-ended haunted ground - a playable sandbox with its own story. The university is the player's home base, where their work will be evaluated, results assessed and where they will be briefed for their next mission.



Visage will be set inside a huge house in which terrible things have happened. Players will relive fragments of the house's history, each of them dragging them closer to whatâ€™s behind the dark history of the place. Players will witness firsthand how people died in the terrifying house. Each death has its visage.
